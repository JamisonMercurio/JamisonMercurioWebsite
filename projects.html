    <td class = "projectText"> ‘See Less Negative News’ User Control - I spearheaded the product strategy, design, and engineering execution for this project at Meta Inc, as well as the many cross-functional POC approvals that were required in order to run a public test. This feature empowers users, via a unit in their feed, to actively remove negative, polarizing feed content. It does this by suggesting use of new topic-based filters, such as Politics, and Crime & Tragedy. Since its successful test and launch, it has been seen by approximately 20 million people, and 500,000+ users have utilized it to transform their Facebook News Tab experience.

    <td class = "projectText"> The Cross Country Crusade: I founded a nonprofit organization where I regularly communicated with government officials, local and national sponsors, ran ad campaigns, and led a team of volunteers on race day. 100% of proceeds are donated to Camp Good Days, a Western New York-based charity that helps children with cancer and their families - and we have raised over $18,000 so far! I now hold an advisor role in the organization. </td>
