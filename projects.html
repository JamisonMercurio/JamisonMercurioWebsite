Add publications section, and add that to linkedin too

Put links on the pictures rather than in the text?

    <td class = "projectText"> The Cross Country Crusade: I founded a nonprofit organization where I regularly communicated with government officials, local and national sponsors, ran ad campaigns, and led a team of volunteers on race day. 100% of proceeds are donated to Camp Good Days, a Western New York-based charity that helps children with cancer and their families - and we have raised over $18,000 so far! I now hold an advisor role in the organization. </td>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="8Puzzle.png" alt="8PuzzleImage" class="projectPhoto"></td>
      <td class = "projectText">8-puzzle solves a slider puzzle using the A* search algorithm. The puzzle is played on a n x n grid with n^2 - 1 square tiles labeled 1 through n^2 - 1, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles in row-major order with as few moves as possible. I implemented the program by creating a Board class that models a nxn board, calculates its hamming & manhattan distances, finds possible neighboring boards, and determines whether a board is solvable. Then, I implemented the A* searching algorithm to solve the puzzle efficiently. </td>

      <td><img src="SeamCarving.png" alt="SeamCarvingImage" class="projectPhoto"></td></td>
    <td class = "projectText"> Seam Carving is an image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel at a time. The algorithm finds a seam in the image with the lowest pixel energies so when the seam is removed, the image seems intact and not distorted. I implemented the algorithm by first calculating the pixel energies of each seam, found the vertical seam of minimum total energy, and then removed the seam. To resize the image horizontally, I transposed the picture before running the same algorithm.  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src= "BurrowsWheeler.png" alt="BurrowsWheelerImage" class="projectPhoto"></td>
      <td class = "projectText"> Burrows Wheeler implements the Burrows-Wheeler data compression algorithm and it outcompresses gzip and PKZIP. The algorithms utilize three smaller algorithmic components, or steps. <u>Burrows-Wheeler Transform</u> transforms a typical English text file to a text file in which sequences of same character occur near each other many times. <u>Move-to-Front Encoding</u> converts the transform file into a text file in which certain characters appear more frequently than others. Finally, <u>Huffman compression</u> compresses the move-to-front file by encoding frequently occurring characters with short codewords and infrequently occurring characters with long codewords.  </tr>

      <td><img src="Autocomplete.png" alt="AutocompleteImage" class="projectPhoto"></td>
      <td class = "projectText"> Autocomplete finds all the terms beginning with a given prefix, in descending order by weight. It functions very similar to the search bar on the Google search engine. I implemented the program by sorting the terms by query string, using binary search to find all query strings that start with a given string, and sorting the matching terms by weight. </td>
