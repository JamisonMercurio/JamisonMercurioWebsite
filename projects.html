Longer Descriptions, For Use When I Change Website Behavior:
‘See Less Negative News’ User Control - I spearheaded the product strategy, design, and engineering execution for this project at Meta Inc. This included soliciting buy-in and approval from team leads on Privacy, Integrity, Legal, Policy, and seven other team POCs. The feature empowers users, via a unit in their feed, to actively remove negative, polarizing feed content. Newly introduced topic-based filters are used, suggesting selection of previously off-limits topics such as Politics, and Crime & Tragedy. Since its successful test and launch, it has been seen by approximately 20 million people, and 550,000+ users have utilized it to transform their Facebook News Tab experience.

        The ‘See Less Negative News’ Filter on Facebook - I wore just about
        every hat for this project at Meta, whether it was playing the product
        manager who pitched and obtained approval for the project from my team +
        many cross-functional partners, building design mockups in Figma,
        executing in my software engineering capacity to build and test the
        feature, and analyzing the experiment data to justify a launch. The
        feature empowers users, via a unit in their feed, to actively remove
        negative, polarizing feed content. Newly introduced topic-based filters
        are used, suggesting selection of formerly off-limits categories such as
        Politics, and Crime & Tragedy. As of late 2022, three million people in
        the United States have activated this feature for their Facebook News
        Tab experience.

        The Cross Country Crusade 5K: I founded a nonprofit organization where I
        regularly communicated with government officials, local and national
        sponsors, ran ad campaigns, and led a team of volunteers on race day.
        100% of proceeds are donated to Camp Good Days, a Western New York-based
        charity that helps children with cancer and their families - and we have
        raised over $18,000 so far! I now hold an advisor role in the
        organization.
